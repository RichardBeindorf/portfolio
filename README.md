This is my first run (into many walls) of bringing life to my vision of a cool and authentic portfolio idea.
All rigths belonging to me - always wanted to say that.

It build with NextJs mainly because of an easy deployment. SSR remains mainly unused, since everything is based on interaction.

I created the line with threeJS inspired by the web-design agency Bürocratik from Portugal.

My goal was to have a very minmalistic but yet techically and design wise interesting site and im quite happy with the result!

Hope you enjoy it too
